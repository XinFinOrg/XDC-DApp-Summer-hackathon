# Call for help

Help me add more wallet providers to EthPress at https://gitlab.com/losnappas/web3-login .

Below is a diary from when I tried web3connect library.

## web3connect

Help me out with testing these wallets.

https://github.com/web3connect/web3connect

### These need an ID that I don't have, so I cannot test.

import Portis from "@portis/web3";
import Fortmatic from "fortmatic";

### Opened a tab that timeouted during my testing.

import Arkane from "@arkane-network/web3-arkane-provider";

### Requires login to service.

import Authereum from "authereum";
import Torus from "@toruslabs/torus-embed";
import Squarelink from "squarelink";
