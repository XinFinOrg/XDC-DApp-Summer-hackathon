## Getting Started

### Downloading And Using As A Plugin

To use this plugin, this repo can be downloaded as a zip and installed as-is as a WordPress plugin. Once installed and activated, Go to wp-admin > Appearance > Menus and edit your menu.

### Getting Set Up For Development

#### Prerequisites

In order to run our Gulp tasks, you will need Node.js and NPM installed. To do so, you can [follow the NPM documentation's guide](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm).
If you have not used NPM before, you can [refer to this beginner's guide to NPM](https://www.sitepoint.com/beginners-guide-node-package-manager/).

This plugin uses a series of [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com) tasks to clean and prepare builds. To get started, run `npm install` to get the necessary gulp dependencies.

#### Gulp Tasks

As normal, we have our gulp tasks in the gulpfile.js file.

Task info coming soon....
