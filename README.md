### How to install

1. Git clone this repo to your localhost folder such as C:\laragon\www\chainfiles. You should have a local web and database server such as [Laragon](https://laragon.org/)

2. Create a database as well as username and password (the usual username is root and password is blank as in empty).

2. Run your localhost server and use your browser to access installer.php file. The URL should be something like https://localhost/chainfiles/installer.php

3. Go through the installation process. 

4. You're all set!
