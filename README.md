## Inspiration
John Paul, co-founder of Paul Mitchell line of hair product borrowed $700 and was able to become successful because of the loan. Thus, we would like to give entrepreneurs chances to borrow XDC funds for their businesses and can become as successful as John Paul. Entrepreneurs can use their valuable items as collateral to borrow XDC funds. 

## What it does
This Dapp allows users to set up an XDC account, send funds, and apply for loans using collateral items.

## How we built it
We built the Dapp using solidity, XDC sdk, and HTML, CSS, Javascript. 

## Challenges we ran into
We had challenges to get the funds from the tested faucet and we had challenges to set everything up and connect with each other. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We were able to deploy the XDC contract and set up the Dapp. 

## What we learned
We learnt about how to deploy XDC contract and set up the Dapp with XDC. 

## What's next for Pawnable
We would like to suggest burn function and NFT transfer function.
