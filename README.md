### How to install

1. Git clone this repo to your localhost folder such as C:\laragon\www\chainfiles. You should have installed a local web and database server such as [Laragon](https://laragon.org/)

2. Create a database as well as username and password (the usual username is root and password is blank as in empty).

2. Run your localhost server and use your browser to access installer.php file. The URL should be something like https://chainfiles.test/installer.php if you use Laragon.

3. Go through the installation process. You might have to [change the admin default password](https://www.linuxshelltips.com/change-wordpress-admin-password-via-phpmyadmin/). 

4. You're all set!

### How it works
1. You need to install MetaMask wallet, then you may log in using that wallet.
